# coding-interview-practice

A Swift Playground with solutions to several coding interview questions.

I wrote this to prepare for the Women Who Code interview workshop, where I got to practice being an interviewer and help folks with solving coding interview challenges!

Link to the interview workshop where I was a practice interviewer:

Coding interview problems in this playground:

* Find the unique number in an array, as described here:
